# ActiveFalsifiedRecord
## a lite version of ActiveRecord: metaprogramming/activerecord practice

Features:

* Lots of test documentation (and yes, all the tests will pass)
* Actual program is split confusingly between several poorly-named files
* Obtain the column names for a SQL table
* Insert into or update table rows
* Get all rows turned into useful Ruby objects, or find them by id or by other attributes
* Narrow down searches with lazily-evaluated, stackable `where` function
* Handle `has_many`, `belongs_to`, `has_one through:` and `has_many through:` associations
